Recent cyber security incidents (e.g., “Wannacry”), caused by software vulnerabilities, showcased the necessity of proactive program analysis. Vulnerability discovery methodologies aim to identify software weaknesses by analysing software, either statically or dynamically. These weaknesses can be leveraged by an attacker who aims to access and/or compromise systems without authorisation.

During the 90s, a novel vulnerability detection method for UNIX systems called “fuzzing" was proposed. Fuzzers are systems that feed assessed code with invalid data (generating random input) aiming to discover new vulnerabilities. Fuzz testing is considered as one of the most important techniques for discovering zero-day vulnerabilities and it is rapidly growing in popularity among the cyber security community. This research project aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of a transferable framework that will be able to leverage Machine Learning to efficiently perform fuzz testing in various systems.
