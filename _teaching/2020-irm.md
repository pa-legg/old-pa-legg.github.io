Information Risk Management teaches students about the operational aspects of cyber security from a business perspective, and brings risk management frameworks such as ISO27001 into practice to consider the holistic view of cyber security threats. It also addresses quantification of cyber risk, based on Cyber Value-at-Risk (VAR) and Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) models.
