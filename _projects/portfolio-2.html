This is an educational project funded by the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). In this project, we demonstrate how the CyBOK has been able to inform the design and development of a Cyber Physical Systems Security tutorial series, to address the respective CyBOK Knowledge Area. As a complex and challenging domain to gain practical experience in, we utilise interactive simulation tools to demonstrate concepts and real-world practice. Working through 6 interactive video tutorials, learners will use FactoryIO, OpenPLC, ScadaBR, and Kali Linux to develop a factory environment, configure industrial programmable logic controllers, and illustrate cyber attack vectors. All resources are made available here for the wider education community.
