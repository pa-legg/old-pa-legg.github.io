As part of CISSEUK, I co-organised [Cyber Education 2022](https://www.cisseuk.org/events) at Roehampton University that saw industry, academia, and government come together to learn about cyber security education challenges, and display practical projects that address solutions. Alan Mills presented our recent paper [OGMA: Visualisation for Software Container Security Analysis and Automated Remediation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9850335) at the [2022 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Security and Resilience](https://www.ieee-csr.org/). I hosted a one day workshop on Cyber Security and Policing research as part of the [Cyber Security and Cyber Crime research cluster](https://blogs.uwe.ac.uk/cyber-security-cyber-crime/).
