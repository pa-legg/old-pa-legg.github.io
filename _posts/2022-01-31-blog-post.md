We have launched a new University-funded [Cyber Security and Cyber Crime Research Group](http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~pa-legg/csc3). We have started our [Institute of Coding Cyber Skills Bootcamp](http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~pa-legg/resources/ioc), and we have started our [Cyber Security Education Workshop for School Teachers](http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~pa-legg/resources/teachers). We have welcomed our January 2022 intake to our [MSc Cyber Security programme](https://courses.uwe.ac.uk/I9001/cyber-security). We have delivered another round of our [Scale Up 4 Growth Gloucestershire](https://www.gloscol.ac.uk/campaigns/scale-up-4-growth-gloucestershire/) workshop on cyber security to industry members, through our partnership with Gloucestershire College. We have welcomed a new PhD student, [James Barrett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-barrett-afciis-769993186/?originalSubdomain=uk), to the CSCT department who will work with [Ribbon Communications](https://ribboncommunications.com/) on Cyber Security in 5G networks.
