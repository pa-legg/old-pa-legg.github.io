I was an invited guest speaker for the [UK Cyber Security Council Leader's Briefing](https://www.ukcybersecuritycouncil.org.uk/events/leader-s-brief-with-special-guest-phil-legg-from-uwe/). I was also an invited guest speaker for the [Let's Make Tech Inclusive event hosted by London Borough of Redbridge](https://digitalvoice.redbridge.gov.uk/let-s-make-tech-inclusive/). I attended [CYBERUK 2022](https://www.cyberuk.uk/website/7174/), the annual government flagship event for cyber security.
