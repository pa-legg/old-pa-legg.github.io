I gave a [Keynote talk at this year's IEEE Cyber Science 2021](https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJrYWoEMb78) conference to address the conference theme of "Advancing cyber security education in a post COVID world". I also presented work on "Hacking the IoT Home" as part of cyber security outreach projects we have conducted over the last 18 months.
