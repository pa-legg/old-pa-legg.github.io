UWE hosted another annual [Unlock Cyber day](https://blogs.uwe.ac.uk/cyber-security-cyber-crime/uwe-bristol-hosts-one-of-regions-largest-cyber-security-events-to-attract-future-talent/) that saw 310 students and 21 schools come to learn about cyber security at UWE Bristol. We had industry partners offering workshops, as well as our cyber scalextric project running for students to play with a hack the scoreboards. Working with psychology, we have been successful in attracting funding for a project "Building a place-based approach to preventing online sexual abuse". The project will commence in September 2022.
