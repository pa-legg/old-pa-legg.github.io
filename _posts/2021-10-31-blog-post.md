We have been successful in attracting funding to support the development of a new Cyber Security and Cyber Crime research cluster within the University. I was part of a panel for the [Future Impact Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/uwebristol/future-impact-podcast-10-the-pros-and-cons-of-cryptocurrency) series, discussing the Pros and Cons of Cryptocurrencies. I successfully passed the [CompTIA PenTest+ PT0-002](https://www.credly.com/badges/d51aeacb-72ab-4d22-8481-4800e1daf912/public_url), and gained the [CompTIA Network Vulnerability Assessment (CNVP)](https://www.credly.com/badges/127c77b0-4630-4a45-8fab-3b50693dd7d6/public_url) recognition. I also acted as an External PhD Examiner at Kingston University, reviewing work in the area of steganography and encryption for mobile banking, and I served as an external assessor for the Open University in the development of a new Cyber Security distance learning module.
