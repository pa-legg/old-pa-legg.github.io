I was invited to give a guest lecture for [City of Bristol College on Cyber Security and the Global Pandemic](http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~pa-legg/talks/20220202-cob_pandemic_talk.slides.html). I served on the [Discribe Hub](https://www.discribehub.org/) assessment panel. I hosted a Splunk4Rookies workshop event in collaboration with Splunk.
