[Phil Legg](https://people.uwe.ac.uk/Person/PhilLegg) is a Full Professor in Cyber Security at the [University of the West of England (UWE Bristol), UK](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/). He is Co-Director of the [UWEcyber](http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/~pa-legg/uwecyber/) Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Education (ACE-CSE), as recognised by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). He is also Programme Leader for the NCSC-certified [MSc Cyber Security](https://courses.uwe.ac.uk/I9001/cyber-security).

His research intersects across Cyber Security, looking at how machine learning, visual analytics, and human-computer interaction are adopted within cyber security, to improve interpretability and understanding of risk, and to improve robustness and trust of modern security technologies. His early research addresses the robustness of machine learning and computer vision systems, as well as how such models can be utilised for insider threat detection and cyber situational awareness. More recently, he is interested in how human-machine teaming can help to establish confidence and trust in human-machine agents, and how active learning techniques can be used to interrogate model robustness and identify security vulnerabilities such as adversarial learning cases. At UWE Bristol, he is an active researcher within the Computer Science Research Centre in the [Department of Computer Science and Creative Technologies](https://www1.uwe.ac.uk/et/csct.aspx).

He studied at Cardiff University for both his BSc Computer Science and his PhD Computer Science. After completing his PhD in 2010, he went on to post-doctoral research and teaching roles at Swansea University (2010-2013) and the University of Oxford (2013-2015), working with a variety of stakeholders across both industry and government. He joined UWE Bristol in 2015 as a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science, and was appointed as Associate Professor in Cyber Security in October 2018, and most recently, Full Professor in January 2022. He holds a Postgraduate Certificate in Teaching and Learning for Higher Education (Distinction), and is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA). He is a professional member of the IEEE and the BCS. He holds CompTIA certifications [PenTest+](https://www.credly.com/badges/d51aeacb-72ab-4d22-8481-4800e1daf912/public_url), [Security+](https://www.credly.com/badges/e2796092-2196-4777-a770-aee25cf68b0a/public_url), and [CNVP](https://www.credly.com/badges/127c77b0-4630-4a45-8fab-3b50693dd7d6/public_url), Microsoft Azure, Security, Data, and AI certifications ([AZ-900](https://www.credly.com/badges/1f4e81fd-d8d8-490a-84f1-e1db736ad533/public_url), [SC-900](https://www.credly.com/badges/52101c96-e767-4cdd-bc1e-bab49e3afb51/public_url), [DP-900](https://www.credly.com/badges/0c345f09-2810-422c-8605-fbbdaa2d70ea/public_url), [AI-900](https://www.credly.com/badges/d517f0c0-a43a-4070-9a0d-fa5a0cceb179/public_url)), and is a certified instructor for Palo Alto Networks. He is recognised as a Full Member of the Chartered Institute of Information Security (MCIIS).
